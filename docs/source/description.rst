The openNPL platform
==============================

**openNPL** is a Python / Django powered platform for working with detailed (*loan level*) data with a particular emphasis on capturing non-performing loan information.

The source code is available in the Open Risk Repository `Link <https://github.com/open-risk/openNPL.git>`_.

Functionality
-------------
The openNPL platform may be useful to financial industry users (portfolio managers, business analysts), data engineers and/or risk model developers. The loan data templates currently covered are in particular relevant for EU countries and the US.

Users can use openNPL to:

* Log-in into the application with their credentials
* Inspect the available loan data sets (tables or relations) conforming to the European Banking Authority Template recommendations of US Agency Loan Performance Data schemas
* Insert, Update or Delete loan records (e.g. new counterparty, loan or collateral data)
* Consult the documentation as to the meaning and requirements of each data element


.. note:: openNPL is still in active development. The functionality of the platform will be significantly enhanced in future versions. If you have specific requests / ideas please raise them in our github repository.

Architecture
------------
The current *architecture* of openNPL is summarized as follows:

* openNPL is built on top of the **Python Django framework**
* The non-performing loan template recommendations of the EBA are implemented as distinct **models** in the database
* A similar but distinct model structure is implemented for US Agency mortgage data
* The backend database is currently **sqlite3**
* Additional models are introduced to bind the data together in relations (e.g. portfolio snapshot)
* The user interface uses built-in Django forms as those are rendered by the **Jazzmin** skin

- **Portfolio_Snapshot** (Segments the loan level data into temporal snapshots / cutoff dates)
- **8 NPL Tables** (Implementing the core European Banking Authority NPL template specification)
- **User** (Inheriting from Django User model)

US Single Family Portfolio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
