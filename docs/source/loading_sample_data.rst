Loading Sample Data
==============================

A new openNPL instance will have no data. To get a feel for the platform it is advisable to load some of the datasets included in the distribution. Here is how to do this for a local installation from sources and docker respectively:


Loading EBA NPL Data into local instance
-----------------------------------------
Inside your virtualenv issue:

.. code:: bash

    bash loadfixtures.sh

This will load a basic dummy dataset. At present this script is very basic.

.. note:: You can select any of the json files available within the fixtures directory, just edit the shell script.

.. code:: python

    python3 manage.py loaddata --format=json DESIRED_FIXTURE_FILE.json


Loading Data into a Docker instance
------------------------------------
In a docker based installation simply execute the above inside your container. For example:

.. code:: bash

    docker exec -it 106bdb7e103f python3 manage.py loaddata --format=json ./npl_portfolio/fixtures/synthetic_data_1.json
