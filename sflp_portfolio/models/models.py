openNPL models implement the core relations (Tables) of the Single Family Loan Performance Template
`Single Family Loan Performance Templates <https://www.openriskmanual.org/wiki/AGENCY_SFLP_Template>`_

Each model is implemented in a separate file using the convention **TABLE_NAME.py** in the sflp_portfolio directory. 
In addition there is a Portfolio model and a Portfolio_Snapshot model in this (models.py) file. 
Choice lists for categorical attributes are collected in separate fields using the convention **TABLE_NAME_CHOICES.py**. 

.. NOTE:: CAS, CIRT and Single-Family (SF) Loan Performance share a common vocabulary with some differences currently not highlighted
