    <h1>Welcome to openNPL</h1>

    <p>
        openNPL is an open source platform for the management of non-performing loans.
        It implements detailed European Banking Authority loan templates for NPL data. Click on <a href="/admin">Home</a>
    to get started!
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:20px">The challenge of Non-Performing Loans</h2>
    <p>Non-Performing loans is a serious and ongoing issue that affects many economies. Developing
        tools and methodologies that will reduce the burden and improve the ability to manage problem
        loans is thus an important objective. For more background and previous work
        see the <a href="https://www.openriskmanagement.com/opennpl-open-source-npl-platform-first-release/">Open
            Risk Blog Post</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:20px">What exactly is openNPL?</h2>
    <p>openNPL is a <i>web application</i> that works together with a tailored data schema to provide easy access
        to NPL data adhering to the regulatory recommendation. Running the application creates a <i>server</i> that
        can then be accessed via any regular browser. For easy installation and testing the current release uses
        an sqlite database instead of a production database.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:20px">Once the platform is up and running a wealth of functionality is available. Just
        as a sample:</p>

    <table class="grp-table grp-full-width" style="margin-top:20px">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>User Functionality</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>

        <tbody>
        <tr class="grp-row-even">
            <td>A user can log-in into the application with their credentials</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="grp-row-odd">
            <td>Inspect the available data sets (tables or relations) that capture the EBA Template recommendations</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="grp-row-even">
            <td>Insert, Update or Delete records (e.g. new counterparty or loan data)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="grp-row-odd">
            <td>Consult the documentation as to the meaning and requirements of each data element</td>
