        <div class="card-body">
            <p>Non-Performing loans is a serious and ongoing issue that affects many economies. Developing tools and methodologies that will reduce the burden and improve the ability to manage problem loans is thus an important objective.

            <h2>What exactly is openNPL?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>openNPL is a <i>web application</i> that works together with a tailored data schema to provide easy
                access to NPL data adhering to the regulatory recommendation. Running the application creates a <i>server</i>that can then be accessed via any regular browser. For easy installation and testing the current release uses an sqlite database instead of a production database.
            </p>

            <p>Once the platform is up and running a wealth of functionality is available. Just
                as a sample:</p>
